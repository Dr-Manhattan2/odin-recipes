# odin-recipes
This is my first webpage project on HTML5.
Im still learning the basics of programming as a whole, surely my commit messages are a mess and this project will be forgoten but its okey to have it as a reminder for my future self.
Im an Argentinian guy who wants to be a future full-stack programmer, im 20 years old at the time im writing this.
This whole web is made by me and the guidance of The Odin Project, an open-source guided curriculum.
All the contents i've been reading, practicing and working on are here, culminating in this web.

Thanks.
